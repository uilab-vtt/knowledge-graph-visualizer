# Knowledge Graph Visualizer

This project is a standalone web-based knowledge graph visualizer that visualizes the knowledge graph JSONLines file in a form of D3.js powered interactive graph. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
